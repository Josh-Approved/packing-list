# Two-device sync E2E UNDER NETWORK CHAOS (packing-list). For each named
# toxiproxy scenario the shared Greece trip is exercised while the fault
# schedule runs, then two oracles are asserted:
#
#   intent   — the write made INTO the degraded link converges once the link
#              recovers: no duplicate row, no resurrected item, and the pack
#              made on the other device is still there (reuses the baseline
#              propagation + D1 flows).
#   honesty  — while delivery is failing the sync indicator must NOT read
#              "Connected" (chaos-honesty.yaml). It reads "Offline" (link cut)
#              or "Not syncing" (publishes rejected). Either is honest; only a
#              lingering "Connected" is the regression this guards forever.
#
# Metro must point at the CHAOS_PORT for this run (the phones connect through
# toxiproxy, not straight at the mini-relay):
